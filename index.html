                                These numbers are shocking, but what's even more shocking is the notion that our
                                government has prescribed generic brand anti-depressants to our soldiers in-place of
                                proven name brand anti-depressants. This is unacceptable, our soldiers are putting
                                their lives on the line for our freedom and we are knowingly compromising their mental health by
                                not supplying them with the brand certified tools they need to facilitate a healthy mental state.
                                <br/><br/>
                                It's outrageous that we are losing 20 soldiers a day to suicide on our own soil because
                                they are not being denied the proper mental health treatment. War is traumatic for all,
                                and our government is not giving our soldiers the health care they deserve.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Too many lives are being lost each year to PTSD and depression. This is especially alarming because these illnesses are very treat- able with several medications that are proven to be effective. So why do the suicide rates persist?
                                <br/><br/>
                                <span class="highlight-green">PTSD is treatable</span>, that’s right treatable.  14 recent scientific studies have demonstrated that with the brand-name serotonin reuptake inhibitors (medication). These are brand Prozac, brand Paxil, brand Celexa, brand Luvox and brand Zoloft.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The base pharmacies, which the veterans also use do not stock the brand medications on the generic medications, fluoxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline.  These generic medications have never been tested in scientific studies for their effectiveness in treating PTSD.  I stopped using them in my practice shortly after they came out because there were not effective in treating my patients with PTSD and depression.  The solution to this problem is simple.  Stock the base and VA pharmacies with the brand medications.  Brand Prozac, brand Paxil, brand Celexa, brand Luvox and brand Zoloft.  The suicide rates would wall drastically and PTSD would not develop into chronic PTSD that lasts a lifetime.
